      <h1>Ricardo Paz's Portfolio</h1>
      <p>I am a student from Michigan State University. I am studying 
          Computer Science with a minor in Cognitive Science. My interest
          with Computer Science began when many companies had data leaks. 
          I am interested in learning about Cyber Security and how to create a 
          more secure digital world.
      </p>
      <p>I am a First Generation Latino Student as well. I am a Mexican Honduran American.
          I love my culture and try to show others why I am who I am.
