      <h1>Ricardo Paz's Portfolio</h1>
      <p>I am a student from Michigan State University. I am studying 
          Computer Science with a minor in Cognitive Science. My interest
          with Computer Science began when many companies had data leaks. 
          I am interested in learning about Cyber Security and how to create a 
          more secure digital world.
      </p>
      <p>I am a First Generation Latino Student as well. I am a Mexican Honduran American.
          I love my culture and try to show others why I am who I am.

      <p> I am currently very involved on campus. I am the Secretary for the Largest Student 
          organization on campus. It is called Culturas de las Razas Unidas. CRU for short.
          I am also part of the Vice President and Chief Diversity Officer Search Committee for 
          Michigan State University.
